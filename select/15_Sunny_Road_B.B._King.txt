Well the war is over
I'm going back down that sunny road
The war is over baby
And I'm going back down that sunny road
Well I ain't get nothing here baby
Baby but my room and board
When I was making good one
Baby you treated me like I was a king
Yeah when I was making good making good baby
Baby you treated me like I was a king
And now hold the one plan job to go home baby
Oh so long so long baby
Baby I've done all that I can afford
Yes goodbye goodbye baby
I've been all that I can afford
Yes some time tomorrow baby
You find me down that sunny road
End
